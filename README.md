<p>The Vim-Vintage colorscheme, also known as the Vi-Vintage colorscheme as I like to call it, was inspired by the [solarized](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized/) colorscheme's subtleness. As well as the look and feel of oil pantings.</p>

## Story
<p>    While I was listening to my Pandora and doing some vim, I came across a piece of beautiful playlist art. I looked from the art and to my vim screen and at once, I imagined the colors swirling like a toilet flush. I imagined my code onto that piece of art and the colors colliding into the text washing the entire screen with light colors. I scratched my nose, and I looked at more paintings that were similar, I found one in particular with more contrasting colors. At once, I imagined the painting filled black like the night, and the colors dancing and shooting across the screen like fireworks revealing text that were hidden. A day after (this was at night, mind you), I started to look into color compliments and accents and did more research... What you see before you is the result of that research.

## Installation
Installation is very simple, and I prefer to keep it simple. You can either use Tim Pope's [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) (recommended) or manually install it.

### Pathogen Installation 
1. Download and install Pathogen.
2. Move the vim-vintage-colorscheme directory into the .vim/bundles directory.
    a. **Clone It!** 
    ```
    $ cd /.vim/bundle
    $ git clone git://github.com/Shaedil/vim-vintage-colorscheme.git
    ```
    b. **Move It!**
    In the parent directory of vim-vintage-colorscheme:
    ```
        mv vim-vintage-colorscheme /.vim/bundle/
    ```
3. (Optional) You can move the vim-vintage color file to your .vim/colors directory for those with less space

## Configuration (Modify your .vimrc)
The commands are easy, because it's similar to other colorschemes:
    ```
    set background=dark
    colorscheme vim-vintage
    ```
Or, if you prefer using the light version try this:
    ```
    set background=dark
    colorscheme vim-vintage
    ```
If you have vim-airline or lightline, add that too.
    ```
     
    ```
**Important Note for Terminal Users** If your terminal is **not** compatible with my colorscheme please look to my temporary documentation for 16 color palette values. Thank you.
